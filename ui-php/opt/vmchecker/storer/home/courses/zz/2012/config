# Deadline      = date
# Machine       = an id of the machine used in testing
# timeout       = a timeout for test execution (override the default)
# AssignmentTitle = a human readable name
# statementlink = a link to the statement
# OrderNumber   = the number of the assignment (used for sorting)
# WaitForVmwareToolsTimeout =
#
#       Optional paramter.
#
#       If WaitForVmwareToolsTimeout is not set, vmchecker waits
#       indefinetly (well not really, the queue manager kills the
#       executor after the global timeout expires).
#
#       This setting is useful when the machines are uploaded by the
#       students and the tools are not preconfigured and we don't want
#       to wait until the global timeout expires.
#
# RevertToSnapshot = [yes|true|y|no]
#
#       Optional paramter.
#
#       If not specified, defaults to 'yes' and reverts the virtual
#       machine to it's last snapshot. If the snapshots are not
#       organized in a straight line (some vmware solutions permit
#       creating trees of snapshots) behaviour is not specified
#       (hasn't been tested yet).
#
#       Normally machines should have a 'last' snapshot in a state
#       that is useful for testing. Having a snapshot cuts the bootup
#       time. Set to 'no' when you really want the machine to boot up
#       by itself.
#
# DelayBetweenToolsAndTests = delay in seconds.
#
#       Optional paramter.
#
#       If not set defaults to '0'. After Vmware tools are loaded,
#       there may be some time before the machine is actually usable
#       (services like apache, mysql, et al. must be started). This
#       defines an amount of time (in seconds) to wait after tools are
#       up, but before starting to run the tests.
