This directory contains the Bachelor Thesis template written by Mircea Bardac
- The thesis text is placed in "src/"
- The thesis is generated into "thesis.pdf"

Debian packages required for building the thesis:
- texlive
- texlive-latex-extra

Setup:
* change everything as needed in src/
* don't forget to change global.tex
* to change the color of the links search for the word "blue"
  in thesis.cs.pub.ro and change it (you might want to print
  the links in black)

Important note:
* The "_" (underscore) character doesn't have to be escaped
  ('underscore' package is used)
* To write in Romanian, uncomment the "Romanian Language support"
  section in thesis.cs.pub.ro and use UTF8 encoding for .tex files
* For different line spacing, write for example \onehalfspacing
  before the part which should be with 1.5 line spacing;
  for example, writing this in "thesis.tex" before "\input{src/main}"
  will make all the chapters with 1.5 line spacing


For more syntax definitions please check thesis.cs.pub.ro.cls.
Some of the definitions and their usage can be found below.

Implemented commands:
% command for formatting inline functions
% Usage (default language = C)
%   \func{function_name}
%   \func[language]{function_name}
%      'language' must be supported by package 'listings'


% command for formatting file names
% Usage: \file{filename}

% command for formatting inline commands
% Usage: \cmd{command with parameters}

% commands for creating labeled hyper-linked references
% Usage: \labelindexref{Section}{sec:intro}
%   creates hyperlink with text "Section <number>"
%   where <number> is the section number of sec:intro
%   pointing to sec:intro
% Usage: \labelref{text for hyperlink}{sec:intro}
%   creates hyperlink with text "text for hyperlink"
%   pointing to sec:intro

% command for inserting labeled figures
% Usage: \fig[params]{file}{label}{caption}
%   where: file is the file name
%          label is the label used for referencing the figure
%          caption is the text appearing with the figure
%          params is a list of parameters accepted
%            by the \includegraphics command, for example "scale=0.5"

% Footnote with hyperlinked URL
% Usage \footnote{\url{http://www.google.com/}}


% Creating abbreviations
%    place it anywhere in the .tex sources
%    does not render the abbreviation at the location where placed
% \abbrev{CS}{Computer Science}

% Adding words/concepts to the index
%    place it anywhere in the .tex sources
%    does not render the words at the location where placed
% \index{context switch latency}

% Inline Listing example
\lstset{language=make,caption=Application Makefile,label=lst:app-make}
\begin{lstlisting}
CSRCS = app.c
SRC_DIR =..
include $(SRC_DIR)/config/application.cfg
\end{lstlisting}

% Listing from file example:
\lstset{caption=Test Specification generation Makefile (Makefile.spec),
label=lst:makefile-spec}
\lstinputlisting{src/code/build/Makefile.spec}


% Table example
\begin{center}
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Generated reports - associated Makefile targets and scripts}
  \begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
    Generated report & Makefile target & Script \\
    \hline
    Full Test Specification & full_spec & generate_all_spec.py  \\
    Test Report & test_report & generate_report.py  \\
