% This file contains the abstract of the thesis

The testing and grading of students' programming assignments is a process 
that requires a lot of time, but also a similar testing environment and 
an objective individual to do the testing.
Vmchecker is a system that allows the automated testing and grading of 
programming assignments with little human involvement.

This project is an attempt to improve the system, by expanding the types of
testing environments and making the process scalable by distributing tasks 
between several workstations.
