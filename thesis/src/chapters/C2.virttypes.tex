\chapter{Extending the types of virtualization}
\label{chapter:virt-types}

The assignments that can be tested by vmchecker vary from simple C or Java
programming assignments to entire virtual machines or kernel modules.
The previous structure of vmchecker did not differentiate between these types of
assignments in any way as it used a VMware virtual machine for everything.

In the next few sections we will look at other virtualization types and see if
they hold any advantages to VMware.

\section{LXC}
\label{sec:vmc-lxc}

While VMware offers an agreeable virtualization environment and a good isolation
between the host and guest machine, simple user space assignments simply don't 
require full machine virtualization. While testing the submissions on the 
physical machine is not an option, because we need to provide the exact same
environment for each test and because it would be vulnerable to fork-bombs and 
other types of attacks. However, an operating system-level virtualization 
environment would prove satisfactory for submissions that only require user space
access.

Between many operating system-level virtualization methods, we have concluded
that LXC is an acceptable choice because of the small effort required to 
deploy, run, and integrate with vmchecker.

LXC is a lightweight virtual system mechanism which builds up from the {\bf chroot}
command by adding resource management and isolation mechanism to Linux's 
existing process infrastructure.

\subsection {Setting Up the Environment}
\label{sub-sec:vmc-lxc-env}

In order to enable the usage of LXC as the virtualization type for testing an 
assignment, several steps must be completed. These steps are described in the 
documentation file found in the repository: \textit{lxc-resources/INSTALL}

First of all, the required packages must be downloaded. To do this, the sysadmin
must  execute the \textit{deps.sh} with root permission. The sysadmin should
setup the interfaces needed to communicate with the container, by copying the
contents of \textit{lxc-resources/interfaces} to \textit{/etc/network/interfaces}.

To avoid using the effective IPs of each container, associations need to be 
added to \textit{/etc/hosts} as following the example in \labelindexref{hosts file}{lst:etc-hosts}


\lstset{caption=Host Aliases,label=lst:etc-hosts}
\begin{lstlisting}
10.3.1.1     deb0 deb0.virt deb0.virt.local # Host alias
10.3.1.11    deb1 deb1.virt deb1.virt.local # First container alias
\end{lstlisting}

Networking should be restarted following this step.

The sysadmin should proceed to set up the LXC container. First of all, he should 
run the commands in \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:create-cgroup} or add the 
following line to \textit{/etc/fstab} so the command will be run at startup:
\lstset{caption=Permanent mounting of cgroup,label=lst:etc-fstab}
\begin{lstlisting}
none /cgroup cgroup defaults 0 0
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{caption=Manually Mounting cgroup,label=lst:create-cgroup}
\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir -p /cgroup
mount none -t cgroup /cgroup
\end{lstlisting}

The \textit{lxc-resources/easylxc} script can now be used in order to create
a new LXC container in which assignments can be tested. The script receives the
name of the container as its argument. In the first stage of the project, only the
first container name, \textbf{deb1}, was created and used.

Because the implementation of LXC was not yet finalized during the implementation
process, the \textbf{lxc-snapshot} command was unavailable so
another way of restoring the container to a previous state
was needed. After creating the container, the sysadmin needs to create a backup
of the newly generated file system.

\lstset{caption=Creating a Backup for the File System,label=lst:create-backup}
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo lxc-backup deb1 1
\end{lstlisting}

Because some operations with containers require root access, in order to
run the executor as a regular user the sysadmin should add the lines in 
\labelindexref{listing}{lst:etc-sudoers} to the \textit{/etc/sudoers} file 
using the \textbf{visudo} command.

\lstset{caption=Uninteractive Sudo Permission,label=lst:etc-sudoers}
\begin{lstlisting}
ALL     ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-start *
ALL     ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-stop *
ALL     ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-info *
ALL     ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-restore *
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Implementing the LXC Executor}
\label{sub-sec:vmc-lxc-executor}

The component of vmchecker which handles interaction with the virtual machine 
is the executor, implemented in \textit{bin/vmchecker-vm-executor}. This script
is called by the queue-manager, on the tester machine, and receives the bundle's
path as its argument. The bundle represents a directory to which the contents
of the received archive have been extracted.

Upon analysing the source code of the executor, it was fairly obvious that
only certain sections needed to be modified in order to provide support for
LXC vitualization. While this fact wasn't necessarily useful at this stage
of the project, it became very important when trying to provide a common and
extensible interface for all the virtualization types.

The original implementation was a collection of functions that passed a 
virtual machine object and a host object, and applied various actions to them.
While certain functions, such as \textbf{connect_to_vm(vmwarecfg, vmx_path)}
called certain VMware VIX functions and were specific to the VMware machine,
others such as \textbf{test_submission(bundle_dir, vmcfg, assignment)}, 
\textbf{copy_files_and_run_script(vm, bundle_dir, machinecfg, test)} and 
\textbf{def start_host_commands(jobs_path, host_command)} were independent
from any external API and even from the actual implementation of the 
methods they called.

My approach was to modify only the methods that were VMware specific, in order
to provide a similar structure to both the LXC executor and the VMware executor.
Control over the container was implemented by using the shell commands
provided by LXC. Running commands inside the container was done by using a 
SSH connection to the container. The python source code is 
provided in \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:lxc-commands}

\lstset{caption=Running Commands,language=python,label=lst:lxc-commands}
\begin{lstlisting}
def guestRun(cmd):
    """ runs the command inside the lxc container """
    _logger.debug("Running in guest: %s" % cmd)
    p = Popen(["ssh root@deb1 "+cmd], stdout=PIPE,shell=True)
    output = p.stdout.read()
    _logger.debug("Guest output: %s" % output)
    return output

def hostRun(cmd):
    """ runs the command on the host """
    _logger.debug("Running on host: %s" % cmd)
    p = Popen([cmd],stdout=PIPE,shell=True)
    output = p.stdout.read()
    _logger.debug("Host output: %s" % output)
    return output
\end{lstlisting}

Using the methods to run commands on the host machine or inside the 
LXC container, one could start the container by calling the 
\labelref{powerOn()}{lst:lxc-poweron} method, or run a command inside the container,
that would return after a given timeout: \labelref{runWithTimeout(cmd, timeout)}{lst:lxc-runtimeout}.

\lstset{caption=Method Called to Power on the Container,language=python,label=lst:lxc-poweron}
\begin{lstlisting}
def powerOn():
    hostRun("sudo lxc-start -n deb1 -d")
    while True:
        o = hostRun("sudo lxc-info -n deb1")
        if not o.contains("-1"):
            return
\end{lstlisting}


\lstset{caption=Method That Runs a Command Inside the Container,language=python,label=lst:lxc-runtimeout}
\begin{lstlisting}
def runWithTimeout(cmd, timeout):
    try:
        thd = Thread(target = guestRun, args = (cmd,))
        thd.start()
        thd.join(timeout)
        return thd.isAlive()
    except Exception:
        return False
\end{lstlisting}


In order to restore the container to a previous state, and as the {\bf lxc-snapshot} 
command was unavailable, we settled with using the \textbf{lxc-backup} and 
the \textbf{lxc-restore} scripts that essentially create a
copy of the file system and later restore it.

\lstset{caption=Restoring the Container to a Previous State, language=python, label=lst:lxc-revert}
\begin{lstlisting}
    def revert(self, number = None):
        if number==None:
            number = 1
        hostRun("sudo lxc-stop -n "+self.hostname)
        hostRun("sudo lxc-restore "+self.hostname+" "+number)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Observations}
\label{sec:vmc-lxc-comments}

Implementing an LXC executor has made \project a much more flexible tool.
While running a VMware machine inside another VMware machine is not recommended,
mostly because of performance issues, running LXC inside the VMware machine
does not noticeably increase the load of the machine. This means that a single
physical machine can now be used to host both the storer and tester, with the
tester being sandboxed inside a VMware machine and the evaluation being done
inside an LXC container.

\section{KVM}
\label{sec:vmc-kvm}

As we described in the previous chapters, OS-level virtualization can only
handle user space assignments. As for assignments such as kernel modules,
we need full system virtualization. This is of course provided by VMware.
However, as we mentioned, the environment is difficult to deploy on 
Linux operating systems and also the virtual machines require VMware Tools
to be installed for a proper communication with the host.

One technology that seems to fit our needs is KVM. The fact that it is closely
integrated with the Linux kernel and that it is able to support basically
any guest operating system through QEMU make KVM a good addition to vmchecker's 
executor types.

\subsection{Setting Up the Environment}
\label{sub-sec:vmc-kvm-setup}

Setting up \textbf{KVM} is an incredibly easy process. Only two packages need
to be installed.

\lstset{caption=Install the Needed Packages, label=lst:kvm-deps}
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt-get install virtinst kvm
\end{lstlisting}

The next step is to create or use an existing kvm virtual machine.
To achieve this task, we used the \textit{/var/lib/kvm/} folder, to which
we copied an existing virtual machine, \textit{saisp-vm.qcow2}.

The virtual machine needs to have the ssh daemon installed and the host's
public key inserted into the {\it authorized_keys} file of the guest. To do this,
the sysadmin should run the command in \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:kvm-run}.
This powers on and opens a window to interact with the virtual machine.

\lstset{caption=Initial run of the virtual machine, label=lst:kvm-run}
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo virt-install --connect qemu:///system --name kvm --hvm --ram 512 --disk path=/var/lib/kvm/saisp-vm.qcow2,format=qcow2 --network network=default --import --vnc
\end{lstlisting}

The {\bf qcow2} format is very convenient to our needs. It is created having
another image file as a base. Any modifications the user might make to the
file system, will only be listed in the newly created file. In order to
revert to the original file system, one only needs to create a new
copy-on-write image file and use that to run the virtual machine.

The next step in the installation process is to create a copy-on-write file 
with the virtual machine image file as its base.

\lstset{caption=Creating the Target File, label=lst:kvm-base}
\begin{lstlisting}
qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b saisp-vm.qcow2 base.qcow2
cp base.qcow2 run.qcow2
\end{lstlisting}

The virtual machine will then be installed started, so the domain name is available
from the executor. Installation will be done without a graphical interface, 
as it's unneeded.


\lstset{caption=Install the KVM Domain, label=lst:kvm-install}
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo virt-install --connect qemu:///system --name kvm2 --hvm --ram 512 --disk path=/var/lib/kvm/run.qcow2,format=qcow2 --network network=default --import --graphics none
virsh destroy kvm2 # stop the VM
\end{lstlisting}

At this point, the KVM domain is installed and available.

\subsection{Implementing the KVM Executor}
\label{sub-sec:vmc-kvm-executor}

Implementing the KVM executor posed different issues from LXC. While the
overall approach was the same, the general architecture of KVM created other
challenges. 

Managing the virtual machines was done in a similar way, by using the available
shell commands provided by \textbf{virsh} while calling the \labelref{hostRun(cmd)}{lst:lxc-commands} method.

One of the major challenges was getting the virtual machine IP. While the
LXC container had a static and well defined IP, the KVM virtual machine gets
its IP through DHCP. The initial approach was to use the serial console of 
the virtual machine an run the \textbf{ifconfig} command on the guest in order
to get its IP. However, this proved unreliable and difficult to automate. The
solution we settled on was to run the \textbf{arp} command on the host, in order
to get the MAC-IP associations. The virtual machine's MAC address can be
recovered from the guests XML description.

\lstset{caption=Getting the KVM Guest's IP, label=lst:kvm-ip}
\begin{lstlisting}
def getMac():
    mac = hostRun("virsh dumpxml kvm2")
    mac = mac[mac.find("<mac address=")+14:]
    mac = mac[:mac.find("'/>")]
    return mac.strip()
    
def getIP():
    mac = getMac()
    while True:
        arps = hostRun("arp -a").split("\n")
        time.sleep(1)
        for arp in arps:
            if mac in arp:
                IP = arp[arp.find("(")+1:arp.find(")")]
                _logger.info("IP: %s" % IP)
                return IP
\end{lstlisting}
       

\section{Implementing a Generic Executor}
\label{sec:vmc-generic}


Having three different scripts to act as executors is unacceptable considering
that the queue-manager is totally unaware of both the assignment's settings
and the executor's implementation. This leads to the conclusion that solutions
need to be integrated in the same executor. As one might also notice, the
three implementations of the executor also share a large portion of code and
would benefit from a refactoring that uses class inheritance.

From the executor's source code we can identify three major method categories:
Host related methods, guest related methods and main method, that parse the
bundle's parameters and call the appropriate functions in order to run the tests.


The {\bf Host} class was defined as shown in \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:generic-host}.
Classes that extend {\bf Host} need to override the {\bf getVM} method in order to return a
VMware, LXC or KVM virtual machine object. The other methods, such as \textbf{executeCommand}
and \textbf{start_host_commands} are already implemented and can be called
without modifications in classes that extend Host, or in other classes or methods.

\lstset{caption=Generic Host Implementation, language=python, label=lst:generic-host}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Host():
    def __init__(self): pass
    def executeCommand(self, cmd): pass
    def getVM(self, bundle_dir, vmcfg, assignment): pass
    def start_host_commands(self, jobs_path, host_command): pass
    def stop_host_commands(self, host_command_data): pass
\end{lstlisting}


The VM class is a collection of methods that define a way to interact with the
given virtual machine. While some methods are implemented, others that are
virtual machine dependent are not. These methods, such as \textbf{start}, 
\textbf{stop} and \textbf{revert}, need to be overriden in the 
class that extends VM and implements the object that defines the interaction
with a certain virtualization environment.

\lstset{caption=Generic VM Implementation, language=python, label=lst:generic-vm}
\begin{lstlisting}
class VM():
    host 	= None
    path 	= None
    username	= None
    password	= None
    IP	= None
    def __init__(self, host, bundle_dir, vmcfg, assignment):    pass
    def executeCommand(self, cmd):          pass
    def executeNativeCommand(self, cmd):    pass
    def hasStarted(self):   pass
    def start(self):        pass
    def stop(self):         pass
    def revert(self, number = None):                    pass
    def copyTo(self, targetDir, sourceDir, files):      pass
    def copyFrom(self, targetDir, sourceDir, files):    pass
    def run(self, shell, executable_file, timeout):     pass
    def runTest(self, bundle_dir, machinecfg, test):    pass
    def try_power_on_vm_and_login(self):                pass
    def test_submission(self, buildcfg = None):         pass
\end{lstlisting}


The new step was to modify the naive scripts implemented for each virtualization
method into new vmchecker modules. Creating a module for the VMware executor
was very simple, and only required translation of the existing methods into a new
class.

As one can see in \labelindexref{Diagram}{img:classes}, there are now three
classes that extend Host: VMwareHost, lxcHost, kvmHost. When calling the
{\bf getVM} method of each of these classes, the coresponding virtual
machine object is returned: VMwareVM, lxcVM, kvmVM.
